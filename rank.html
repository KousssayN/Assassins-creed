                <p>2014 was not a good year for Assassin's Creed. Both releases received the lowest scores of any
                    console games in the entire franchise, with Assassin's Creed: Unity achieving a score of 71 on
                    Metacritic. The plot is set during the French Revolution and centers on Arno Victor Dorian's efforts
                    to expose the true powers behind the revolution. It's a setup AC fans had been hoping to see for
                    some time, but it was marred with shortcomings.</p>

                    average weighted score of 83 on Metacritic.
                    The game courted some controversy when it was accused of anti-British sentiment while promoting

                <p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is a prequel to Valhalla, taking place 11 years before in ancient Baghdad,
                    with its story centering on a street thief turned Hidden One, Basim Ibn Ishaq. Basim plays a key
                    role in Valhalla, but Mirage is perfectly playable as a standalone experience, using its
                    predecessor's foundation to deliver a game closer to the classic stealth action the series was known
                    for originally. The overarching story of Mirage falters in some key places, but its gameplay is a
                    delightful throwback, and the majority of its immediate narrative within Baghdad more than makes up
                    for any low points.</p>
